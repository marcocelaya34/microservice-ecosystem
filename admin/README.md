# Admin

This project is a React-based admin application that utilizes Auth0 for user authentication. The admin panel is designed to manage users and transactions, with role-based access control to restrict actions based on user roles. Transactions are created and communicated to the API using GraphQL.

## Key Features

    Secure user login using Auth0.

2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Users are assigned roles that determine their permissions within the admin panel.

3. Transaction Management: Users with the appropriate permissions can create and view transactions.

4. GraphQL Integration: Transactions are sent to the backend API using GraphQL.
